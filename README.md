# Work Day, Scheduler Starter Code

We provide html and css for this task

The user story is: as a busy employee
I want to add important events to the daily schedule
So that I can effectively manage my time and accept standards

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner,
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down,
THEN,Then I will see the time block of standard working hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day,
THEN, each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN,Then, when I click the save button for that time period, I can enter an event
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN,Then the saved event persists



My first thought was to have a string with variables for any hour, date, and time, but spend time with TA and change my approach:approach: 
NOTE Array, work good the hole week, But I made changes and stopped working.

This part was replaced by this, unfortunately the array stopped working

Propably,For me, the most challenging part is probably the local storage  Still have problems understanding how to work,

At the beginning of this challenge, my idea was created in html textare and timeblock, so I wrote some code on html, but time I changed my idea of time Just create a piece of code on the

old html code:

and then I change to:

This screen on the console check Local Storage is getting the information.
