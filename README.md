We are provide with html and  css for this task

The user story is:

I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively


and Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

My first thoght was have a string with variable for any hour,day and time but spend time with a Charles TA  and change my approach:
